# Objective: 
* Part A: Work with Client Sessions and data persistence using MongoDB to add user registration and
Login/Logout functionality & tracking (logging)
* Part B: Update the password storage logic to include "hashed" passwords (using bcrypt.js)

# Specification:
For this assignment, we will be allowing users to "register" for an account on your BTI325 App. Once users are
registered, they can log in and access all related employee/department views. By default, these views will be
hidden from the end user and unauthenticated users will only see the "home" and "about" views / top menu
links. Once this is complete, we will add bcrypt.js to our code to ensure that all stored passwords are "hashed"
