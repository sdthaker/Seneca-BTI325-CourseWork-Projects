## Due: Sunday, Sep 26 th, 2021 @ 11:59 PM

## Objective:

### This first assignment will get you setup with your environment, tooling, and a Heroku account as well as

### introduce you to the development workflow used in this course (Visual Studio Code + Git + Heroku).

## Specification:

### For this assignment, we will be publishing our first web app on Heroku.

### Step 1: Installing Software

### In order to create web applications and publish them online, you will need to download and install the

### following software.

- Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Heroku CLI (Command Line Interface)
    (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install)

### Step 2: Following the Guide

### The next step involves following along with the " Getting Started With Heroku " Guide available on the

### course website week 2 note.

### https://web322.ca/getting-started-with-heroku

### Step 3: Customizing the server code (server.js)

### Once you have completed the guide (Step 2), and have a simple "Hello World" app running on Heroku, you

### must personalize the output:

- Instead of "Hello World" – change your app to output your full name and student number.
- **HINT** : If you make any changes to your server.js file after publishing to Heroku, you will have to:
    o Commit your changes to your local git repo using the following procedure:
        Click on the Source Control Icon in the sidebar that has a "1" on it in Visual Studio Code
        Enter a message (in the "Message" box) describing your change, ie "updated server.js"
        Click the checkmark above the message box to commit your changes.
    o Push your changes to Heroku by issuing the command: " git push heroku master" from the
       Integrated Terminal in Visual Studio Code

## Assignment Submission:

1. Add the following declaration at the top of your server.js file (do not forget to **include the URL to your app on**
    **Heroku** :

2. Compress (.zip) the files (name it a1.zip) in your Visual Studio Code working directory (this is the folder that
    you opened in Visual Studio Code – it should contain a **node_modules** folder, a **server.js** file and a **package.json**
    file)
3. Submit the zip file (a1.zip) on Blackboard -> Assignments -> A
4. Late submission will be penalized with 10% of this assignment marks for each school day up to 5 school days,
