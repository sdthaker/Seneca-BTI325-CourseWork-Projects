# Objectives: 
Build upon the code created in Assignment 3 by incorporating the Handlebars view engine to render our JSON data visually in the browser using .hbs views and layouts. Additionally, update our data-service module to allow for employees to be updated using a web form.

# Specification:
As mentioned above, this assignment will be built upon your code from Assignment 3. To begin, make a copy of your assignment 3 folder and open it in Visual Studio Code. Note: this will copy your .git folder as well (including the "heroku" remote for assignment 3). If you wish to start fresh with a new git repository, you will need to delete the copied .git folder and execute "git init" again in.
